ðŸ“ˆ Predicting Houses & ðŸ“‰ Prices using ANN.

# 1.Introduction
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
It's a great dataset for evaluating simple regression models.

# 2. Objective 
* Predicting house price based on the features of the house.

# 3.TensorFlow & Keras
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.
TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research.

Keras Tuner is an easy-to-use, scalable hyperparameter optimization framework that solves the pain points of hyperparameter search. Easily configure your search space with a define-by-run syntax, then leverage one of the available search algorithms to find the best hyperparameter values for your models.

**TensorFlow 2.0** was announched in June 2019, they declared that **Keras** is now the official high-level API of TensorFlow for quick and easy model design and training.

# 4.Artificial Neural network



* Neural networks adapt themselves to the changing input so that the network generates the best possible result without the need to redesign the output criteria.
*  The functionality of neural networks is often compared to the one of the multiple linear regression, where one uses multiple input features, also called independent variables, to predict the output variable, the dependent variable. 
*  In Neural Network we also use input features, referred as Input Layer Neurons to get information and learn about the outcome variable, referred as Output Layer.
*  The main difference between such regression and Neural Network is that, in the case the former the process runs in one iteration by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals (similar to cost function), whereas in case of Neural Network there is an intermediate step portrayed by the Hidden Layer Neurons which are used to get signals from the input layers and learn about the observations over and over again until the goal is achieved, the cost is minimized and no improvement is possible. 
*  So, one can say that ANNs are much more sophisticated than multiple linear regression.

# 5.Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.It is a one of the crucial step in data science that allows us to achieve certain insights and statistical measure that is essential for the business continuity, stockholders and data scientists
